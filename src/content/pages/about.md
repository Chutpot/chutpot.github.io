Chutpot Studio is a small game team that blends art direction, game design, and engineering. We care about feel, readability, and replayability.

We focus on:

- Atmosphere-first worlds with deliberate tone
- Combat and traversal that feel responsive on controller
- Systems that encourage experimentation and multiple runs

We prototype fast, playtest early, and polish the details that make moment-to-moment play satisfying.
